+ Project summary: In our project,we use human resources data provided on Kaggle to analyze that under different scenarios how likely an employee will leave in the following years. We use five models: For the Cox Regression model in survival analysis, we forecast the leaving probability in the next few years. For the Random Forest model, Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree model, Naive Bayes model, we predict the current state(leave/stay) of an employee given different conditions. We develope an RShiny app for users to explore our models and form a report to give our analysis explicitly.
