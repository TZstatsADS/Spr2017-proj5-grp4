+ Project summary: In our project,we use human resources data provided on Kaggle to analyze that under different scenarios how likely an employee will leave in the following years. We use two models: For the Cox Regression model in survival analysis, we forecast the leaving probability in the next few years. For the Random Forest model, we predict the current state(leave/stay) of an employee given different conditions. We develope an RShiny app for users to explore our models and form a report to give our analysis explicitly.
